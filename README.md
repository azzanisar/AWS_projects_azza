Welcome to my AWS projects repository! This repository contains various AWS-based projects that I am working on through various learning platforms like NextWork guidelines 
and AWS Skill Builder. This respository will include my journey from beginner projects to more advanced as I familiarise myself with cloud technology and gain essential AWS skills. 
My goal is to gain hands-on experience with AWS services, cloud architecture, and best practices for deploying scalable applications.
